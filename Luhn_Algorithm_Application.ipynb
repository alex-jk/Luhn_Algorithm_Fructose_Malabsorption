      "Background: Fructose malabsorption is characterized by the inability to absorb fructose efficiently. As a consequence fructose reaches the colon where it is broken down by bacteria to short fatty acids, CO2, H2, CH4 and lactic acid. Bloating, cramps, osmotic diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequence and can be seen in about 50% of fructose malabsorbers. Recently it was found that fructose malabsorption was associated with early signs of depressive disorders. Therefore, it was investigated whether fructose malabsorption is associated with abnormal tryptophan metabolism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods: Fifty adults (16 men, 34 women) with gastrointestinal discomfort were analyzed by measuring breath hydrogen concentrations after an oral dose of 50 g fructose after an overnight fast. They were classified as normals or fructose malabsorbers according to their breath H2 concentrations. All patients filled out a Beck depression inventory questionnaire. Blood samples were taken for plasma tryptophan and kynurenine measurements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results: Fructose malabsorption (breath deltaH2 production >20 ppm) was detected in 35 of 50 individuals (70%). Subjects with fructose malabsorption showed significantly lower plasma tryptophan concentrations and significantly higher scores in the Beck depression inventory compared to those with normal fructose absorption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusions: Fructose malabsorption is associated with lower tryptophan levels that may play a role in the development of depressive disorders. High intestinal fructose concentration seems to interfere with L-tryptophan metabolism, and it may reduce availability of tryptophan for the biosynthesis of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine). Fructose malabsorption should be considered in patients with symptoms of depression and disturbances of tryptophan metabolism.\n",

      "current url: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28965810/\n",
      "This prospective cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the potential association between primary-adult lactose malabsorption, fructose malabsorption, tryptophan (TRP) metabolism and the presence of depressive signs. Overall 251 patients, who were referred for lactase gene C/T polymorphism genotyping and fructose hydrogen/methane breath testing, were included. All participants filled out the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI II). Serum concentrations of tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), kynuric acid (KYNA), and TRP competing amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, tyrosine) were measured by high-pressure liquid-chromatography. Logistic regression analysis was performed with lactose malabsorption, fructose malabsorption and all potential biomarkers of TRP metabolism to assess the effect on signs of depression, defined as a BDI II score > 13. Primary-adult lactose malabsorption and fructose malabsorption was detected in 65 (25.90%) and 65 (25.90%) patients, respectively. Fructose malabsorption was significantly associated with BDI II score, whereas no such relationship was found for lactose malabsorption. Serum levels of TRP and TRP metabolites were no predictors of depression. The authors suggest to conduct further prospective longitudinal studies in order to get further insight of associations between carbohydrate malabsorption, biomarkers and mood disorders.\n"

      "Researchers at Monash University in Australia developed dietary guidelines for managing fructose malabsorption particularly for individuals with IBS.\n",
      "Glucose enhances absorption of fructose so fructose from foods with fructosetoglucose ratio 1 like white potatoes are readily absorbed whereas foods with fructosetoglucose ratio 1 like apples and pears are often problematic regardless of the total amount of fructose in the food.\n",
      "Foods with high fructosetoglucose ratio.\n",
      "However the concept of a high fructose load has not been evaluated in terms of its importance in the success of the diet.\n",

      "Even in healthy persons however only about 2550 g of fructose per sitting can be properly absorbed.\n",
      "Similarity in symptoms means that patients with fructose malabsorption often fit the profile of those with irritable bowel syndrome.\n",
      "Recently it was found that fructose malabsorption was associated with early signs of depressive disorders.\n",
      "Bloating cramps osmotic diarrhea and other symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are the consequence and can be seen in about 50 of fructose malabsorbers.\n",

    "#### Results Discussion\n",
    "The final implementation of the summarize function successfully processes and summarizes the given text, accounting for various sentence delimiters (.;\\n\\t) and extracting the most relevant sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a summary of the process and the findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire corpus of articles was concatenated into a single text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summarize function was then applied to this text. The function first replaced various sentence delimiters with periods and ensured that there is a space after each period. It then removed all non-alphanumeric characters except for the standard punctuation marks (.,!?, and ;).\n",
    "\n",
    "The nltk.sent_tokenize function was used to split the text into sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then processed the sentences, tokenized them, and created a frequency distribution of the words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 25 most common words were selected, and a score was assigned to each sentence based on the frequency of these common words and their distance from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 25 highest-scoring sentences were then selected as the most relevant sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a collection of sentences that highlight the key aspects of the corpus, such as the symptoms of fructose malabsorption, its impacts on gut microbiota and mental health, the role of fructose-to-glucose ratio, foods with high fructose load, and dietary management strategies. The output includes specific details about foods, symptoms, and dietary guidelines. Some sentences like \"Foodlabeling .\" and \"Gastroenterology.\" seem out of context, but this could be due to the lack of context in the original text or the fact that these terms appear frequently in the text, thereby getting a high score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the summarization function works well for the given text, but there's always room for improvement. For example, the scoring mechanism could be improved by using more advanced techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or by incorporating a pre-trained language model. Additionally, the function could be modified to handle other non-standard sentence delimiters and formatting issues."
